## Node implementation

I decided to make a spike branch to implement the backend of this app using a Node framework. I chose [Express](http://expressjs.com/ "Express") because of its popularity. I also considered using [KOA](http://koajs.com/ "KOA") but it requires an unstable release of Node. Other notes to come.
